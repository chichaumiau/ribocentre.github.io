Ribocentre is designed to contain comprehensive information of all Ribozyme that have been isolated by in vitro selection and in vitro evolution. In addition to sequence information, you will find links to the original publications, reaction conditions, reaction substrates, metal-ion requirements, and structural information whenever available. <br><br><br><br>






**You can add some information of your found about new Ribozyme ! We are pleasure if you could contact us with different opinion !**

> Do you want to submit a new Ribozyme ? You could add your information by click the button.
